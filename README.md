# RLAFY
Remove Limited Ads From Youtube - Automatically request manual review for all of your videos

This extension will request the manual review for all of your demonetized videos. **IMPORTANT:** Right now, youtube is only able to review videos with at least 1,000 views in the past 7 days. RLAFY directly can't approve your video for monetization. Also, all of your videos should be [suitable for all advertisers](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278).

## How to use
Just download it from the release page and install the `.crx` file into your browser. Then go on your [videos page](https://www.youtube.com/my_videos?o=U&pi=1) and RLAFY will start to request manual review for all of your demonetized videos. When the process ends you will be notified with an alert.
